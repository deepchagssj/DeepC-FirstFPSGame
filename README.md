My First Game - First-Person Target Shooter

Developed with Unreal Engine 5 to learn the ins and outs of a simple first-person shooter.

Used pre-existing models for the environment, the gun, the targets, and default animations available in Unreal - I'm not a graphic artist, of course, so being resourceful where I can be! To get my head in the space of a developer and know the basic ins and outs of a tool that is used by millions every day. Looking to also be able to put together prototypes to share my ideas and get them across to stakeholders and fellow team members using Unreal Editor 5.5.
